# Smart Web Crawler Demo

In this demo, we’ll explore how Skyfire enables seamless, token-based payments for crawling protected websites, and how its batch-based charging model benefits both data providers and consumers.

### The Problem: Crawling Protected Content

Traditional web crawlers often hit a wall when they encounter protected content. Website owners want to monetize their data, while authorized crawlers need a way to pay for access.

### The Solution: Skyfire’s KYA+PAY Token

Skyfire introduces a **token-based payment system** that allows crawlers to access protected content in a secure, auditable, and automated way. Here’s how it works:

- **Token Generation:** The crawler agent requests a KYA+PAY token from Skyfire’s API, specifying the amount of access or data required.
- **Token Submission:** The crawler includes the token in the HTTP headers of its requests to the protected website.
- **Batch-Based Charging:** Instead of charging for every single request, the protected website can **charge tokens in batches**—for example, after every 10 pages crawled, a single token deduction is made. This reduces transaction overhead and makes the process more efficient for both parties.
- **Verification and Enforcement:** The protected website verifies the token and tracks usage, ensuring that only authorized crawlers with sufficient balance can access the data.

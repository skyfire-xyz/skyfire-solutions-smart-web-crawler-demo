- Create a Pusher Account and App:
      - Go to the Pusher website and create a new account or sign in to your existing one. 
      - Navigate to the Pusher Channels dashboard and create a new app. 
      - Give your app a name and select a cluster (region) closest to your users to minimize latency. 
- Get Your Pusher Credentials:
      - After creating the app, find and click on it in the dashboard. 
      - Go to the "App Keys" tab to find your app_id, key, secret, and cluster. 
      - Store these credentials securely, as they will be needed to configure your application.
